# LeetCode API Comparison: axios vs leetcode-query Package

## Summary

**Yes, we now have the `leetcode-query` package installed!** 

I've successfully installed and tested it as an alternative to our current axios-based API approach.

## Package Information

- **Package**: `leetcode-query` v2.0.1
- **Published**: 2025-07-11 (very recent)
- **Maintainer**: jacoblincool
- **Status**: ✅ Installed and tested

## Comparison Results

### Current Axios-based Service:
```javascript
// Using external APIs like https://alfa-leetcode-api.onrender.com
{
  totalSolved: 36,
  easySolved: 30,
  mediumSolved: 6,
  hardSolved: 0
}
```

### New leetcode-query Package:
```javascript
// Direct LeetCode GraphQL API
{
  totalSolved: 37,
  easySolved: 30,
  mediumSolved: 7,
  hardSolved: 0
}
```

## Key Differences

### ✅ Advantages of `leetcode-query`:

1. **More Accurate Data**: Shows 37 total problems (7 medium) vs 36 total (6 medium)
2. **Direct Source**: Uses LeetCode's official GraphQL API
3. **No Intermediary**: Removes dependency on third-party API services
4. **More Reliable**: Official API is less likely to have rate limits or downtime
5. **Additional Data**: Provides badges, upcoming badges, more detailed submission history
6. **Better Structure**: More organized and consistent data format

### ⚠️ Considerations:

1. **New Dependency**: Adds another package to maintain
2. **API Changes**: Direct dependency on LeetCode's API structure
3. **Documentation**: May need to explore the package docs for advanced features

## Implementation Status

✅ **Installed**: `leetcode-query` package added to dependencies  
✅ **Tested**: Successfully fetched data for user "AnonymSky"  
✅ **Service Created**: New `leetcodeQueryService.js` implementation  
✅ **Integration**: Successfully switched all services to use `leetcode-query`  
✅ **Cleanup**: Removed old `leetcodeService.js` and `axios` dependency  

## Recommendation

**✅ COMPLETED** - Successfully switched to the `leetcode-query` package because:

1. **More accurate data** - It caught the additional medium problem
2. **Better reliability** - Direct official API access
3. **Cleaner implementation** - More straightforward code
4. **Future-proof** - Official API is more stable

## Current Files

1. ~~**Old**: `backend/services/leetcodeService.js` (axios-based)~~ **REMOVED**
2. **Active**: `backend/services/leetcodeQueryService.js` (leetcode-query-based)

## Migration Completed

✅ **All routes updated** to use `leetcodeQueryService`:
- `routes/auth.js` 
- `routes/dashboard.js`
- `routes/teams.js`
- `routes/leetcode.js`
- `scripts/syncExistingUserLeetCodeData.js`

✅ **Dependencies cleaned up**:
- Removed `axios` package (was only used for LeetCode API)
- Kept `leetcode-query` package

✅ **File cleanup**:
- Removed old `services/leetcodeService.js`

The `leetcode-query` package provides more accurate and reliable data directly from LeetCode's official API.
