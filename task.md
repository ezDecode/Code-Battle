## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Tips

### Quick Wins
```javascript
// Use this for rapid LeetCode API testing
const fetchLeetCodeProfile = async (username) => {
  const query = `
    query getUserProfile($username: String!) {
      matchedUser(username: $username) {
        username
        profile {
          ranking
          userAvatar
          realName
        }
        submitStats {
          acSubmissionNum {
            difficulty
            count
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `;
  
  // Implementation here
};
```

### Database Optimization
- Index frequently queried fields (userId, teamId, assignedAt)
- Use aggregation pipelines for leaderboard calculations
- Implement caching for static data (problem lists)

### PWA Essentials
```javascript
// Minimal service worker
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('v1').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/',
        '/static/js/bundle.js',
        '/static/css/main.css',
      ]);
    })
  );
});
```

## ðŸ“Š Demo Script Preparation

### Key Demo Points
1. **User Onboarding**: Show registration with LeetCode username
2. **Team Formation**: Demonstrate creating/joining teams
3. **Challenge Flow**: Show problem assignment and verification
4. **Competition**: Display leaderboards and scoring
5. **PWA Features**: Demonstrate offline functionality

### Demo Data Setup
- Create 3-4 test teams with different skill levels
- Pre-populate some completed challenges
- Set up realistic leaderboard data
- Prepare mobile and desktop views

## âš¡ Contingency Plans

### If LeetCode API Fails
- Implement mock API responses
- Use static problem database
- Manual verification option

### If Real-time Updates Are Complex
- Implement simple polling (every 30 seconds)
- Use localStorage for client-side updates
- Add manual refresh button

### If Team Features Are Complex
- Start with individual competition only
- Add teams as enhancement if time permits
