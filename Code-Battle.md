# Enhanced Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Gamified LeetCode Tracker - "CodeBattle"

### 🎯 Vision Statement
A competitive platform where developers form teams and compete through daily LeetCode challenges, fostering consistent coding practice through gamification.

### 🏆 Core Value Proposition
- Transform solo coding practice into team competition
- Maintain coding consistency through peer pressure and gamification
- Skill-appropriate challenge assignment
- Real-time competitive tracking

## 📋 MVP Features (Hackathon Scope)

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: Simple form with LeetCode username
- **Team Creation/Joining**: Users can create teams (max 4 members) or join existing ones
- **Profile Dashboard**: Shows personal stats, current team, and recent activity

### 2. LeetCode Integration
- **Data Fetching**: Use LeetCode's GraphQL API to fetch user submission data
- **Skill Level Detection**: Analyze recent submissions to categorize users (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Submission Verification**: Check if assigned problems are completed

### 3. Challenge System
- **Problem Assignment**: Assign problems every 12 hours based on user level
- **Difficulty Distribution**: 
  - Beginner: 70% Easy, 30% Medium
  - Intermediate: 20% Easy, 60% Medium, 20% Hard
  - Advanced: 10% Easy, 40% Medium, 50% Hard
- **Problem Pool**: Curated list of high-quality problems per difficulty

### 4. Scoring & Competition
- **Point System**:
  - Easy: 1 point
  - Medium: 3 points
  - Hard: 5 points
  - Bonus: +1 point for solving within 2 hours of assignment
- **Team Scoring**: Sum of all team members' points
- **Leaderboards**: Individual and team rankings with real-time updates

### 5. User Experience
- **Challenge Notifications**: In-app notifications for new challenges
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars and streak counters
- **Problem History**: Last 7 days of challenges and completion status

## 🚀 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
**Duration**: 6-8 hours
- [ ] Set up React app with PWA configuration
- [ ] Create basic UI components (Dashboard, Navigation)
- [ ] Set up Node.js/Express backend
- [ ] Configure MongoDB connection
- [ ] Implement user registration and basic authentication

### Phase 2: LeetCode Integration (Day 1-2)
**Duration**: 6-8 hours
- [ ] Research and implement LeetCode API integration
- [ ] Create user skill level detection algorithm
- [ ] Build submission verification system
- [ ] Test API reliability and rate limits

### Phase 3: Core Features (Day 2)
**Duration**: 8-10 hours
- [ ] Implement team creation and management
- [ ] Build challenge assignment system
- [ ] Create scoring algorithm
- [ ] Develop problem history tracking

### Phase 4: Competition Features (Day 2-3)
**Duration**: 6-8 hours
- [ ] Build individual and team leaderboards
- [ ] Implement real-time score updates
- [ ] Add streak tracking and bonus point logic
- [ ] Create responsive leaderboard UI

### Phase 5: Polish & PWA (Day 3)
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Add PWA features (offline support, installability)
- [ ] Implement push notifications for challenges
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness and UI polish

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- LeetCode API integration functions
- Scoring algorithm accuracy
- Challenge assignment logic

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end user registration to challenge completion
- Team scoring calculations
- Leaderboard updates

## 📈 Success Metrics
- User engagement: Daily active users
- Competition effectiveness: Average problems solved per user
- Platform reliability: API uptime and response times

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)
- Email notifications for challenges
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Custom team challenges
- Integration with other coding platforms
- Social features (comments, problem discussions)
- Mobile app development

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation
- **LeetCode API limits**: Implement caching and rate limiting
